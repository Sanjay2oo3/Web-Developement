    <!--Tags:
    In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and content of a webpage. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the opening and closing tags is affected by the tag. For example, the <h1> tag is used to define a heading level 1, and the text between the opening and closing tags will be rendered as a top-level heading.-->

    <h1>This is H1 Tag in HTMl</h1>

    <!--Elements:
    Elements are made up of tags and the content between them. They define different parts of a webpage and contribute to its structure. Elements consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some common elements include headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, and tables.-->

    <!--Attributes:
    Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are specified within the opening tag of an element. They are used to modify the behavior or appearance of an element. Each attribute has a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=). For example, the src attribute in the <img> tag specifies the source (URL or file path) of the image to be displayed.-->
