<body>
    <ul>
        <li>When you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create.</li>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</li>
        <li>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</li>
        <li>I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits</li>
    </ul>
