        <h1>Apple Inc</h1>
        <p>
           Apple Computer was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. The third founding member, Ronald Wayne, quickly sold his ownership to Jobs and Wozniak. Their first product was the Apple I microcomputer, which they built in Jobs' family garage. It was sold as a single board with CPU and RAM, but without other basic components such as a keyboard and monitor.

            Apple devices are renowned for their design aesthetic and attention to detail. Tight integration between hardware and software gives their systems a performance advantage over competitor systems with similar specifications.

            Apple rose to its position as a market leader by correctly positioning its products. They didn't invent personal computers, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), mp3 players, smartphones, smartwatches or tablets. Instead, they produced some of the first versions of these products that were refined, easy to use and well-designed, which led to wide market adoption.
